And as the field continues to advance, these systems will mature and enable us to interact with information directly by using our voice and commands.  \r\n\r\nThis will allow clinicians to not only completely avoid typing to capture information, but also to simply ask for information about their patients and have that data displayed on a screen. Theoretically, they might never need a keyboard.\r\n\r\nText parsing and information extraction:\r\n\r\nThe use of NLP in regard to text parsing is focused on the extraction of information from unstructured or semi-structured documents like text, dictations or scanned and indexed health records.  This information is then used either for reporting or collection and indexing for future use.  These text parsing tools help clinicians extract meaningful, actionable information from data stored in unstructured formats, whether those are EHRs or other health information sources.\r\n\r\nNatural language to command or sort queries:\r\n\r\nNLP interacts with users through voice, which may seem to be an idea torn from a sci-fi flick. But consider examples such as IBMâ€™s Watson, or some of the pilot projects previously made around natural language interfaces to databases. We can ask simple questions and a computer system can translate them into actual commands or queries that can in turn be used to look up specific information.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nToward a Natural Language Interface for EHR Questions\r\nKirk Roberts, PhD and Dina Demner-Fushman, MD, PhD\r\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4525248/\r\n\r\nThe Use of Mobile Phone and Medical Apps among General Practitioners in Hangzhou City, Eastern China.\r\nLiu Y1, Ren W, Qiu Y, Liu J, Yin P, Ren J.\r\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27220417\r\n\r\nNatural Language Search Interfaces: Health Data Needs Single-Field Variable Search\r\nCaroline Jay1*, PhD ;  Simon Harper1*, PhD ;  Ian Dunlop1* ;  Sam Smith2, PhD ;  Shoaib Sufi1 ;  Carole Goble1 ;  Iain Buchan2, MD, FFPH, FACMI \r\n\r\nImproving Access to Online Health Information With Conversational Agents: A Randomized Controlled Experiment \r\nTimothy W Bickmore et al., J Med Internet Res\r\nhttp://www.jmir.org/2016/1/e1/?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=JMIR_TrendMD_%25SPONSORED%25\r\n\r\nGo to SYMBOL7TH\r\n\r\nSYMBOL7TH\r\nABOUT A Digital Health transformation agile collaboration between, medics and their finger on the pulse, web developers, graphic designers, for a saving of lives.\r\nhttps://medium.com/symbol7th\r\nhttps://twitter.com/symbol7th\r\nhttps://www.7thsymbol.co/",
